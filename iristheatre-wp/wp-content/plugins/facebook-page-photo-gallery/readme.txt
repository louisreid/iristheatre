Showcase your Facebook Page photos in a fancy gallery that surpasses even Facebook's.

== Description ==
This Plugin fetches a Facebook Page Photo Album as a JSON object and uses [Fancybox](href="http://fancybox.net "Fancybox" ) to render the gallery in wordpress
It is specifically for public photos particularly those belonging to a Facebook Page if you would like to show Photos and albums belonging to users and friends then consider [Facebook Walleria Plugin](http://zoxion.com). You do not need special
permissions, just the album ID and boom! If your albums do not show at first try and your are sure you have done everything correctly, it may be because you need more permissions. You can use [Facebook Walleria Plugin](http://zoxion.com).

Version 2.0 was completely rewritten and makes use of wordpress shortcodes.
